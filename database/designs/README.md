# Design Samples
 
Below are samples of database design files that I produce for projects.
 
## ERD

This is the design and relationship of the tables that belong to the sample project. 

I typically use the ERD to provide an overview of how the tables relate, with which type of relationships, and show
primary and foreign key values on the diagram. 

## Data Dictionary

This is a supplemental file to the ERD above. 

I'll generate a data dictionary to accompany the ERD that is produced for the database design. The data dictionary
contains all the information about the individual fields in each table, data types and other constraints, and
descriptions of the tables and fields.
