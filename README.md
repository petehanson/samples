# Samples For Peter Hanson

This repository contains various samples of work that I have done for different projects.  They include both programming examples, in a couple of different languages, samples of tests provided in those languages, and also examples of architecture documents that have been assembled.

These are not complete projects and in some of the descriptions I have to be vague in describing the product or the company.

## Full Projects

### DBPatch

URL: https://github.com/petehanson/dbpatch

This is a basic database migration/patching system that I developed and have iterated on over a few years. It can be used on projects, where there isn't a readily available patch management system in place for the code base.

### Emailer

URL: https://github.com/petehanson/emailer

This is an extension of SwiftMailer that allows the developer to use a configuration based appraoch to store and handle context about specific system emails that it needs to send. It contains a tag replacement based system and ways to tie in and link in replacement values for tags in the templates.

## PHP

This contains various examples that have been done in straight PHP and framework supported development. There is also a tests folder that contains samples of various tests I've built for the projects in questions.

## JavaScript

This contains various examples that have done in JavaScript. I have samples from Angular.js projects, tool sets that have been built on Node.js, and tests around those.

## Architecture

This contains various architecture projects or documentation that I've assembled that I'm allowed to share.
