# SCSS Files

## _globals.scss, _responsive.scss, and _navigation.scss

These three examples are a segment of a SASS file system that creates one unique CSS file that drives presentation. 
Files are segmented by functional code blocks, reusing variables and mixins for creating an easy to maintain system.
These files are dependent on reusable code in other files. Those files display the results, like the navigation and
responsive behavior of the layout, along with global elements and layout for the web application.
