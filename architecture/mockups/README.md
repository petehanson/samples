# Mockups

## DAM Mockups - Frontend - 20160404.pdf

These mockups were assembled in Balsamiq Mockups, the tool I typically use for construction of my Mockups. The Mockups showcase how the front end of a digital asset manager would work, operating in the context of managing contracts for an organization.  The tool would provide asset upload/download capabilities, commenting, version tracking, a tickler system on the asset, access control list support, and instance versions (think multiple images of a single master image).

This application hasn't been built, but I've had a couple of different companies I've worked with interested and have explored the possibilities with this. If this is a solution that you think would work for you, I'd be interested in talking. Reach out by email and we can talk about how this could be used as a solution.
